                            How I Got Here I grew up in Rizal, a province in CALABARZON, with my siblings. We spent nearly nineteen 
                            years there, enjoying simple pleasures like watching movies, shopping, and swimming in Manila's big 
                            resorts. But when COVID-19 hit the Philippines, everything changed. We had to move to my parents' hometown
                            in Western Samar, specifically Sta. Margarita Samar. Here, I faced the harsh realities of life, but I've 
                            learned to keep pushing forward, no matter how tough it gets. Living in Sta. Margarita Samar, I've come 
                            to realize the importance of resilience and perseverance. Despite the challenges, I continue to grow and 
                            learn, embracing the journey of life. Though it hasn't been easy, I'm determined to overcome obstacles 
                            and make the most out of every opportunity that comes my way.

                        In terms of my programming skills, I have a strong command of HTML, with proficiency at 75%. HTML 
                        allows me to structure and create web pages effectively. However, I still have room for improvement,

                        of 30%. While I understand the basics of JavaScript and can implement simple functionalities, I need
